2.4.12

The most effective implementations would be a heap or an ordered array.
This is because the worst case bound for the find the maximum operation in a heap and in an ordered array is O(1).
In an unordered array it is O(n).
Also, the heap would be slightly better than the ordered array because, even though there is a small number of insert operations, they have worst case bound of O(n) on the ordered array and O(log n) on the heap.
